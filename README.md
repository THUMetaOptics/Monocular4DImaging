The MATLAB codes allow initialization and optimization of metasurface phase and 4D reconstruction (including 2D all-in-focus intensity, depth, and polarization) of an experimental single-shot imaging. They are based on the paper:

Shen, Z., Zhao, F., Jin, C. et al. Monocular metasurface camera for passive single-shot 4D imaging. Nat Commun 14, 1035 (2023).
